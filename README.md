## About this Project

This is a repository of my favourite settings for the Fender Blues Jr Guitar Amp (Mine is the IV model, using a celestion speaker).

The motivation was to keep the settings in one place where I can access it when needed. Simple as that!

When I discover a new tone I like (after tweaking for hours), I save it to data/bluesjr.js

This repository deploys from Github to Netlify at https://relaxed-kowalevski-4527ac.netlify.app and you can have it added to your favourites as I do, as it is very handy to have the settings at hand during a gig. Feel free to suggest new settings via Pull Request and/or fork this project to keep your own settings.  

## TODO

I would like to include the guitar model and suggested settings on the guitar for each tone.
